# fastapi-project-template
A ready to use project template for scalable FastAPI API's

## Why use this template?
This project template can be a great first step to start a scalable REST API without thinking about ORM integration, how to manage migrations
or what architecture should I use. These desisions are carefully taken for you this will help you be more productive and concentrate on the business logic.

## What features do this template bring?
  1. A project structure inspired from real world example and Django.
  2. SQLAlchemy as the ORM integrated.
  3. Alembic for databse migrations management.
  4. Poetry for dependency management.
  5. Pytest with a fixture for test database.
  6. Generic CRUD class for all models.
  
 ## How to use it?
 To use this project template you have to [install cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/1.7.2/installation.html)
 Cookiecutter will allow you to create the project interactively. All you have to do is add paramaters like project name version ect...                
 Run this command:
 ```
 $ cookiecutter https://github.com/khalilSaidane/fastapi-project-template.git
 ```
 
 ## Next step
 The next step is to crate a FastAPI application we have a template for that too [here](https://github.com/khalilSaidane/fastapi-application-template.git).
